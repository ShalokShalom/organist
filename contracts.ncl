      tracking the dependencies that need to be built before the string can make
      sense.

      Anything expecting a `NixString` accepts a pure Nickel string as well. A
      `NixString` also accepts a Nix string fragment, which can be a Nickel
      derivation, a Nickel derivation, a Nix path (built from `lib.import_file`), pure
      Nickel strings, and maybe more in the future.

      A `NixString` accepts any sequence of Nix string fragment as well.

      A `NixString` is best constructed using the symbolic string syntax. See
      the Nickel example below.

      # Nix string context

      In Nix, when one writes:

      ```nix
      shellHook = ''
        echo "Development shell"
        ${pkgs.hello}/bin/hello
      ''
      ```

      Nix automatically deduces that this shell depends on the `hello`
      package. Nickel doesn't have string contexts, and given the way values
      are passed from and to Nix, this dependency information is just lost when
      using bare strings.

      Sometimes, you may not need the context: if `hello` is explicitly part
      of the inputs, you can use a plain string in a Nickel
      expression as well:

      ```nickel
      shellHook = m%"
        echo "Development shell"
        %{pkgs.hello.outputPath}/bin/hello
      "%
      ```

      # Example

      However, if you need the dependency to `hello` to be automatically
      deduced, you can use symbolic strings whenever a field has a `NixString`
      contract attached. The result will be elaborated as a richer structure,
      carrying the context, and will be reconstructed on the Nix side.

      To do so, juste use the multiline string syntax, but with an `s` prefix
      instead (**Warning**: the `s` prefix is as of now temporary, and subject
      to change in the future):

      ```nickel
      shellHook = nix-s%"
        echo "Development shell"
        %{pkgs.hello}/bin/hello
      "%
      ```

      Note that:
        - we've used the symbolic string syntax `nix-s%"`
        - instead of `hello.outputPath`, we've interpolated `hello` directly,
          which is a derivation, and not a string

      Within a `NixString`, you can interpolate a Nix String, or a Nix string
      fragment, that is a Nix derivation, a Nickel derivation, a Nix path (built from
      `lib.import_file`), pure Nickel strings, and maybe more in the future.

            Set additional environment variables for the builder.

            `structured_env` is usually preferred over `env`, as the former is
            easier to merge and to override.


            # Format

            `structured_env` is a record whose fields are environment variables
            (`buildInputs`, etc.). The values are records
            themselves, which represents _named pieces_ that are joined together
            to form the final value of the variable.

            For example:

            ```nickel
            structured_env.buildInputs = {
              bash = inputs.bash,
              curl = inputs.curl,
            }
            ```

            This structured environment corresponds to a variable `buildInputs` with
            value `"%{inputs.bash} %{inputs.curl}"`. Note that the order
            isn't preserved. The `bash` and `curl` names don't appear in the
            final value, but they are used for composability and overriding.

            ## Combining

            For example, imagine defining a shell in two different records, that
            are merged together: `builder1 & builder2`. `builder1` defines the
            structured environment given in the example above. Because
            `structured_env.PATH` is a recod, you can simply write in
            `builder2.ncl`:

            ```nickel
            structured_env.buildInputs.other-package = inputs.other-package,
            ```

            The final result will be a path with all three subpaths separated by
            `:`.

            ## Overriding

            Because pieces are named (`bash`, `curl`, `other-package`), you can
            override them specifically using merging:

            ```nickel
            structured_env.buildInputs.bash | force = inputs.special-bash,
            ```

            # Interaction with `env` and `attrs`

            Usually, you should only work with `structured_env`. If you override
            `attrs` directly, be aware that **`structured_env` will then be
            potentially completly ignored**.

          Set additional environment variables for the builder.

          You should use `structured_env` where possible.

          If you override `attrs` directly, the value of `env` might be ignored.

            *Directly* pass arbitrary attributes to the Nix derivation.

            These attributes will appear as environment variables inside the
            build, and will be available in `.attrs.json` file.

            Unlike `env`, the fields here can be of any type, including
            arbitrarily deep records. As a consequence, you should NOT pass
            symbolic strings (including `nix-s%"..."%`) here.

            By default, `attrs` is computed from values of `env` and
            `structured_env`. It is almost always better to use `structured_env`
            or `env` instead of `attrs`, unless you wish to pass deeply nested
            attribute sets or non-string values.
