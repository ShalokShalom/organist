        Nickel doesn't have a mechanism like Nix
        [string contexts](https://shealevy.com/blog/2018/08/05/understanding-nixs-string-context/) yet.

        If you rely on string contexts to automatically deduce
        inputs for you, you must use this function to build a Nix string as
        a list of fragments. A fragment is either a plain Nickel string or a
        derivation coming from Nix. Those fragments will be eventually
        contatenated on the Nix side.

        # Example

        In Nix, when one writes:

        ```nix
        shellHook = ''
          echo "Development shell"
          ${pkgs.hello}/bin/hello
        ''
        ```

        Nix automatically deduces that this shell depends on the `hello`
        package. Nickel doesn't have string contexts, and given the way values
        are passed from and to Nix, this dependency information is just lost.
        Sometimes, you may not need the context: if `hello` is explicitly part
        of the inputs, you can use a plain string in a Nickel
        expression as well:

        ```nickel
        shellHook = m%"
          echo "Development shell"
          %{pkgs.hello}/bin/hello
        "%m
        ```

        However, if you need the dependency to `hello` to be automatically
        deduced, you can use this function `nix_string_hack` to preserve the
        dependency information. To do so, cut the string in question into
        fragments to get rid of the string interpolation. One
        fragment needs to be `pkgs.hello`. In this case, the remaining fragments
        can just be the whole strings before and after `%{pkgs.hello}`, because
        they are static strings without interpolations of other Nix derivations:

        ```nickel
        shellHook = nickel_string_hack [
          m%"echo "Development shell""%m,
          pkgs.hello,
          "/bin/hello"
        ]
        ```

        In the future, we will hopefully have a native mechanism similar or subsuming
        string contexts in Nickel.
